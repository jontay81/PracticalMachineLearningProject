##Objective

The goal of this document is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which the participant did the exercise. Participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

This report will describe:
1. How the model was built
2. How cross-validation was used
3. What the expected out of sample error is
4. Why choices were made.
